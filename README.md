# Softwares and codes used for my Bachelor Thesis.
For [my Bachelor Thesis](https://noesis.uis.edu.co/items/478aeafb-279a-4670-9ba6-fd6c6e34c6d5) I extensively used routines and Monte Carlo simulations for modeling processes such as the creation of EAS (Extensive Air Showers) and the interaction of muons with the ground. My initial goal was to make use of a full pipeline of simulations starting with the creation of atmospheric profiles via GDAS for their use on CORSIKA (a software for estimating EAS) and the integration of the MAGNETOCOSMICS software for correcting the flux of secondary cosmic rays according to the magnetic field (based on [this](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2017SW001774) work). Also, I ended up integrating a Geant4 environment edited in such a way to easily study the interaction of muons with the ground, which I refer to as MFS (Muon Forward Scattering) in my thesis.

This work has served as a good proof of concept for exploring the chained use of these software packages and independent computer codes, and seeing that, indeed, this simulation pipeline is useful and valid in a real scientific concept, like the study of MFS I carried out in my thesis. Taking into account the importance of science communication and the sharing of useful tools, I created this GitHub repository that contains the codes designed and edited by me and my thesis supervisors, that were used on this simulation pipeline.

This repository is divided in two: a first section dedicated to the simulation of EAS inside the folder *CORSIKA_MAGNETOCOSMICS*, and a second section with our Geant4 environment for the study of MFS inside the folder *Geant4/G4_Muon_Scattering*.

## **CORSIKA_MAGNETOCOSMICS**
For the modeling of EAS we designed two Python codes, written and documented on Jupyter Notebooks that would help the user on two important stages of the simulation chain: the creation of monthly atmospheric profiles via GDAS (based on [this work](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.01224.pdf)) and the correction of the spectrum of secondary cosmic rays taking into account geomagnetic effects (based on [this work](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303024725_Modulacion_de_Rayos_Cosmicos_Secundarios_a_Nivel_del_Suelo_por_Cambios_en_el_Campo_Geomagnetico) and [this work](http://tangara.uis.edu.co/biblioweb/tesis/2020/178633.pdf)). Our approach was to start off from the codes already created for the cited works and designing our own Notebooks with the goal of simplifying their use.
